The topic of my B. Tech Project is <b>Simultaneous Space-Time Complexities of Variants of Reachability.</b>

Graph reachability, particularly in directed graphs, plays a pivotal role in theoretical computer science and practical applications such as routing, database queries, and verification systems. This project examines three foundational papers that propose innovative approaches to solving reachability problems under specific constraints, such as sublinear space, polynomial time, and planar graph structures.

The selected papers are:

<b>1.​ An O(n1/2+ϵ)-Space and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Directed Planar Reachability -</b> This paper presents a polynomial-time reachability algorithm for directed planar graphs that achieves O(n1/2+ϵ )- space bound.​

<b>2.​ A Sublinear Space, Polynomial Time Algorithm for Directed s-t Connectivity -</b> This paper focuses on designing an algorithm for directed s-t connectivity that uses sublinear space while maintaining polynomial time complexity.​

<b>3.​ Simultaneous Time-Space Upper Bounds for Red-Blue Path Problem in Planar DAGs -</b> This paper exhibit a polynomial time and O(n1/2+ϵ) space algorithm for the RedBluePath problem and EvenPath problem in planar DAG.
